## Software

### Software architecture
Software used,

### Software install
how to download and run the code

## Video demonstration

### Channel 1

### Channel 2

## Observations
Note about some intermittent errors running the program - what error and how to fix it.

Occasional delay when calibrating gyro sensor. Why?

Issue with my remote - code not picking up two or more button presses correctly with repeatability.

Kit from 2016..age an issue?

## Future work/suggestions
Upgrades to channel two: 
if an obstacle is in its way, it will have to go back and turn left or right and proceed onto the driving to the beacon
 
- For beacon channel 3 - moving around randomly (say for 5 seconds) and avoiding obstacles. Make your robot drive around a room while avoiding obstacles with the Infrared Sensor in Proximity mode.
- For beacon channel 4 - actively avoiding objects that come too close.
