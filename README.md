# lego-ev3-segway

README file to be updated.

Using ev3dev OS to self-balance a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot. 

## Future upgrades

Upgrades to channel two: 
if an obstacle is in its way, it will have to go back and turn left or right and proceed onto the driving to the beacon
 
- For beacon channel 3 - moving around randomly (say for 5 seconds) and avoiding obstacles. Make your robot drive around a room while avoiding obstacles with the Infrared Sensor in Proximity mode.
- For beacon channel 4 - actively avoiding objects that come too close.

Combine channels 3 and 4?
