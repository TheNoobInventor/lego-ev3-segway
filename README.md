Using ev3dev OS to self-balance a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot

## Further work to try out

Upgrades to channel two: 
if an obstacle is in its way, it will have to go back and turn left or right and proceed onto the driving to the beacon
 
- For beacon channel 3 - moving around randomly (say for 5 seconds) and avoiding obstacles. Make your robot drive around a room while avoiding obstacles with the Infrared Sensor in Proximity mode.
- For beacon channel 4 - "social distancing mode", actively avoiding objects that come too close.

Can we combine channels 3 and 4??
